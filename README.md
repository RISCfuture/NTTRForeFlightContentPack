Pull requests are welcome! Please expand this content pack with more up-to-date
or additional data relevant to operations within the NTTR. Please check the
guidelines before contributing, though.

### Guidelines

- Location must be relevant to military air training operations within the NTTR,
  either in general or for specific large-scale or persistent training
  operations (such as RED FLAG).
- Data must be unclassified and publicly available.
- Fixes that are already a part of ForeFlight's aeronautical data (such as
  `FYTTR`) are not included.
